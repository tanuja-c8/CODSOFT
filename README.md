# 🚀 CODSOFT Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to my **CODSOFT Data Science Internship Repository!**  
This repository contains all **four tasks** completed during the internship under Data Science.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
🔍 Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, and passenger class.

✨ Key Highlights:
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
- Model training using **Logistic Regression / Random Forest**
- Evaluation using accuracy score & classification report

### 🔹 Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction
🎬 Predict IMDb movie ratings using machine learning based on movie-related attributes.

✨ Key Highlights:
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Implemented **Regression models (Linear Regression / Random Forest Regressor)**
- Evaluated model performance using R² score & MSE
- Exported trained model using pickle

### 🔹 Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
🌸 Classify iris flowers into **Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica** using petal & sepal measurements.

✨ Key Highlights:
- Data visualization with scatter plots
- Model training using **SVM / KNN / Decision Tree**
- Measured accuracy and model performance
- Prediction on new unseen data

🔹 Task 4: Sales Prediction using Python
📈 Predict sales based on advertising spending on **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**.

✨ Key Highlights:
- Dataset analysis and preprocessing
- Trained regression model (**Linear Regression**)
- Visualization of actual vs predicted sales
- Generated insights for business decisions
